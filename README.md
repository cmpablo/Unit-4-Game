DESCRIPTION ------------------------------------------

Crystal Collector... a simple Javascript game for everyone to enjoy!


HOW TO COLLECT CRYSTALS ------------------------------

You will be given a random number at the start of the game.

There are four crystals below. Clicking on a crystal will add a specific amount of points to your total score. The value of each crystal is unknown until you click on it. At each start of the game, a new random number will appear and the values of each crystal will be reset.

You win the game by matching your total score to the random number. You lose the game if your total
score goes above the random number.

Good luck!
